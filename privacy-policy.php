                    <h2>Privacy Policy Statement</h2>
                    <p>This section of the website describes in detail the privacy policy adhered to by Design Vikings (“we”, “us”, “the website”, “the company”, “agency”).

                    <h2>Treatment of Collected Information</h2>
                    <p>The information collected is primarily used to deliver a better website experience by knowing the different customer’s preferences for products and offering similar services to them. Moreover, the billing information is collected because it is inevitable to process orders without transactional information. The email address of the customer is used for maintaining healthy communication including order status updates, comments about services, opinions on services and the delivery of the final product to the end customer. The email can also be used for promotional purposes such as marketing new offerings, website updates, and marketing promotions as well as communicating the latest trends/news within the industry. All of this together helps us to provide better services and improve our marketing strategies while also providing analytics on which products are selling better.</p>
