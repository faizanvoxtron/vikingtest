                    <h2>REVISION POLICY</h2>
                    <p>The number of revisions each individual/customer gets is based on the package ordered from the Design Vikings website. The customers can demand as many revisions as stated in their respective packages. One of the main focuses of Design Vikings is to provide customers with 100% satisfaction. For that matter, we offer unlimited free revisions to achieve this objective unless the customer sticks to the original brief and the initial requirements remain the same. In case of a change in requirements, or customer demanding revision after the acceptance of the initial design, or a change of mind or disagreement with the partner, the revisions will no longer be entertained. The turnaround time for revision will be two (2) business days or 48 business hours.</p>
